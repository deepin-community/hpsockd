Signals</H1></CENTER>
The following signals are used to signal sockd:
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
SIGHUP</H2>
Causes sockd to re-read the configuration file.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the new
configuration file fails to parse, the previous configuration remains intact.
<H2>
SIGINT</H2>
Indicates that the log file has moved, and sockd should reopen its log
file.&nbsp; At some point, this will include rewriting the startup lines
for all open connections.
<H2>
SIGIOT</H2>
Indicates that sockd should no longer listen for new connections.&nbsp;
The listen socket is closed (meaning that a new daemon can be launched.)
<H2>
SIGTERM</H2>
Close all connections and terminate.
<H2>
SIGUSR1</H2>
Dump client information.
<BR>XXX - not implemented
<H2>
SIGUSR2</H2>
Dump configuration.&nbsp; This is done in a format that can be fed back
in as a configuration file, albeit not identical to the one that was read.
